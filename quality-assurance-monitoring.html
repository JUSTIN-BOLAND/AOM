<h2 class="title text-center">Quality assurance and monitoring</h2>
<p>It is essential to ensure that all your data is as correct as possible. Significant errors, such as undetected
    deviations between imported platform data and data within the platforms itself, might seriously harm your marketing
    efforts. You should therefore establish sound monitoring and alerting processes.</p>


<!-- Logging -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Logging</h2>
<p>Various console-commands and background tasks (importing, merging etc.) write their logs to
    <code>aom-tasks.log</code>. All other logs (visitor requests, requests to this plugin's API endpoints, Piwik UI
    interactions etc.) are written to <code>aom.log</code>. All log files are stored in Piwik's main directory.</p>

<p>You can filter <code>aom-tasks.log</code> for specific console-commands and background tasks by searching for strings
    like <code>{"platform":"AdWords","task":"import"}</code> or <code>WARNING</code>.</p>

<p>It might be a good idea to rotate these log files on a daily basis.</p>


<!-- Monitoring -->

<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Monitoring API endpoints</h3>
<p>By monitoring the <a href="api.html">API endpoint AOM.getStatus</a> you can easily validate
<ul>
    <li>that Piwik gathers tracking data like visits and orders,</li>
    <li>that the marketing data imports are working and</li>
    <li>that the matching of visits and marketing data is working.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Monitoring database contents</h3>
<p>...</p>

<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Monitoring log files</h3>
<p>You should monitor <code>aom-tasks.log</code> automatically. Some checks that might be useful:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search for errors during AdWords' import:
        <code>grep "ERROR" aom-tasks.log | grep "AdWords" | grep "import"</code></li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Manual monitoring efforts</h3>
<p>...</p>


<!-- Alerting -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Alerting</h2>
<p>Based on the monitoring possibilities described above, you should setup alerting processes that inform those who are
    responsible as soon as possible after an error is being detected.</p>
